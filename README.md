# Inspiration
**Why this analysis ?**

Kenya is the economic, financial, and transport hub of East Africa. Kenyaâ€™s real GDP growth has averaged over 5% for the last decade. Since 2014, Kenya has been ranked as a lower middle income country because its per capita GDP crossed a World Bank threshold.

Retired President Kenyatta and his former Deputy, now President Ruto, pledged to make economic growth and development a centerpiece of his second administration, focusing on his "Big Four" initiatives of universal healthcare, food security, affordable housing, and expansion of manufacturing. 

The "Big Four" initiatives will have a tremendous impact on Kenyan GDP. This analysis is as a result of my instrest in the Kenyan GDP Growth and prediction with the influence of the "Big Four" initiatives projects since 2017 when Retired President Kenyatta and his former Deputy pledged to make economic growth and development a centerpiece of his second administration, focusing on his "Big Four" initiatives.
